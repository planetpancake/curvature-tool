# curvature-tool
A little tool I whipped up to calculate how much of the earth would be in the way if you were trying to view something a very long distance away.

Under the folder src/ you will find a runnable python script called main.py.
When you run it, it will produce the result at the bottom of this file.

The "viewing distance" section tells the distance to the point you're looking at.
The "arc" section tells you how many degrees of Earth's circumference we're looking at.
The "Covered by curvature" section is the "sagitta", as it's called, or how much the earth would be covering the thing you're looking at.

It's worth mentioning that I've used equations that assume your eyes are on the ground, so if you dig yourself a pit and use a telescope, or simply place a camera on the ground, you should be able to test these results for yourself.
